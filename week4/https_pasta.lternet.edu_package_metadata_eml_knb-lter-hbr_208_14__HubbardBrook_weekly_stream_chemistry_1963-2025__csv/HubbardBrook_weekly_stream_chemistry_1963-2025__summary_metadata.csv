Dataset_Abstract,"The Hubbard Brook Watershed Stream and Precipitation Chemistry Record is a dataset of chemical concentration data for precipitation and streamwater samples that have been collected weekly since the summer of 1963 from streams and precipitation gauges throughout the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, a research forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. HBWatER currently collects weekly samples from nine gauged watersheds, the mainstem of the Hubbard Brook into which each small stream drains, and two long-term precipitation collection sites. HBWatER was begun in the 1960's by Gene E. Likens, F. Herbert Bormann, Robert S. Pierce, and Noye M. Johnson who began collecting and analyzing stream and precipitation (rain and snow). They had a simple idea, that by comparing watershed inputs in rain and snow to watershed outputs from streams, they could measure the behavior of entire ecosystems in response to atmospheric pollution or forestry practices. Stream and precipitation samples have been collected every week from 1963 to the present day. Insights gained from studying this long-term chemical record led to the discovery of acid rain in North America and have documented the effectiveness of federal clean air legislation in reducing coalfired power plant emissions.; The collection and analysis of HBWatER samples is currently sustained by Tammy Wooster (Cary IES) and Jeff Merriam (USFS) and the dataset is curated and maintained by a team of researchers: Chris Solomon (Cary IES), Emily Bernhardt (Duke), Bill McDowell (UNH), Charley Driscoll (Syracuse U.), Keith Nislow (USFS), and Mark Green (Case Western). Current Financial Support for HBWatER is provided by NSF LTREB # 2401760 and the USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station.; These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which is operated and maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station."
Dataset_Methods,"Site description:; a. Site type: The site is an experimental forest located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, operated under the supervision of the Northern Research Station of the United States Forest Service.; b. Geography: The Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) is approximately 32 km2 and ranges in altitude from 222 to 1,015 m.; “The HBEF is located within the townships of North Woodstock (~60 %), Ellsworth (~40 %), and Warren (&lt;1 %), NH, within the White Mountain National Forest of north central New Hampshire. Coordinates of 43°56′ N, 71°45′W bisect the area. The Atlantic Ocean is about 116 km to the southeast. The nearest town is West Thornton, NH.” (Likens 2013); c. Habitat: The ecosystem is a mixed temperate hardwood forest dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis).; d. Geology: Bedrock geology is composed of quartz-mica schists and quartzite of the Silurian Rangeley Formation. Significant glacial deposits overlay much of the landscape. Soils are of the spodosol and inceptosol orders.; e. Watersheds/hydrology:; “The experimental watershed-ecosystems range in size from 12 to 77 ha and in altitude from 500 to 910 m. These headwater watersheds are all steep (average slope of 20–30 %), with well-incised channels and relatively distinct topographic divides. The height of the land surrounding each watershed-ecosystems, the area, and the topography all have been determined from ground surveys and aerial photography and most recently augmented by Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). Experimental Watersheds 1–6 face S to SE; Watersheds 7–9 face N to NE.” (Likens 2013); f. Site history: Secondary forest, logged ca. 1910. Extensive treatment of the site history can be found in Holmes and Likens (2016) and on the HBES web page (https://hubbardbrook.org).; g. Climate: mean annual precipitation - 1434 mm, mean annual temperature - 6°C; 2. Sampling design: The sampling design is exhaustively described in the USFS technical report by Buso et al. (2000).; ; Executive Summary of Methods: Water samples are collected every Monday from all stream sites and rain gauges. Water is collected in acid washed, HDPE bottles and returned to the lab for filtration. At the time of collection, the field technician records gauge height for each watershed and precipitation volume for each rain gauge. Stream samples are always collected from the same location.; Samples are returned to the USFS Pierce laboratory at Hubbard Brook within hours of collection. There samples are analyzed for DIC, pH, electrical conductivity. Beginning in 2017 they were also examined spectrophotometrically at five wavelengths. A subsample is filtered and shipped to the USFS Durham laboratory for subsequent analyses. The remainder of the (unfiltered) sample is stored in the water sample archive at USFS Pierce lab.; Details on the Precipitation Chemistry Samples: Perhaps the most important aspect to explain here is the way in which the precipitation dataset is curated. Contamination issues always plague rain sampling efforts, and the policy for the HBEF long-term record has been to curate the dataset heavily so that only high quality sample information is retained. To help explain this we provide the following historical overview of the approach to QA/QC of precipitation samples.; Precipitation Chemistry records within the dataset were compiled from separate sites at Hubbard Brook to represent the “best” sample (read “cleanest”) for each weekly collection period. In the early years of the HBES, the issue of precipitation contamination by coarse particles (e.g., seeds and leaves) was clearly seen as a potential problem in open collectors. While not exclusively a ‘growing season’ problem, the worst incidents tended to occur in the summer and fall. Several attempts were made to eliminate foreign objects, such as screens, wads of poly-wool, and use of wet-only automated collectors, but these were problematic in their own way. Screens had to be kept clean, and sometimes precipitation was ‘filtered’ through trapped debris. It was eventually decided that for ecosystem inputs, a bulk (continuously open) collector was the most appropriate choice. This required the positioning of several collectors so that at least one sample collected from at least one site each week would be reasonably clean.; Although occasional grossly contaminated samples were not analyzed (that is, thrown out after collection), most precipitation samples were sent to the analytical lab for solute determination even in the presence of amorphous fine particulates. It turned out that some fine particulates seemed to dissolve and influence the analysis (probably bird feces), while others appeared to be relatively inert (probably fine pieces of bark or grit). There was no evidence, in the early days of the record, that selecting chemistry from different sites around HBEF would result in significant bias. In fact, the existence of particulate contamination was considered a more important factor in QA/QC than any potential difference in chemistry across the valley. Long-term data since then bear this out as a general truth. Of course, the resulting input flux values were always calculated using the closest volumetric rain gauge, or a pattern of rain gauges in the case of a whole watershed, since the variation in precipitation volume is significant.; From 1963-1969, South facing precipitation (samples labeled “S”) samples were chosen from the “cleanest” precipitation data. After 1969, we report the raw data for all uncontaminated samples collected from any rain gauge.; Research methods for sample analysis: The analytical methods prior to 2013 are exhaustively described in the USFS technical report by Buso et al. (2000). Samples were analyzed at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies (Millbrook, NY).As of June 2013, after careful inter-laboratory comparisons, chemical analyses were transferred from the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies to the USDA Forest Service Lab in Durham, NH. Analytical methods during this period (June 2013 to present) are summarized in the table below. # HBWatER Analytical Methods (June 2013 to Present)| Analyte Code | Analyte Description | Method Description | Method Reference ||--------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|| DOC | Dissolved Organic Carbon | High Temperature Catalytic Oxidation w/ NDIR detection | EPA 415.3 Rev. 1.1 || TDN | Total Dissolved Nitrogen | High Temperature Catalytic Oxidation w/ chemiluminescent N detection | Merriam et al. 1996 || F | Fluoride | Ion chromatography with chemical suppresion | EPA 300.1 || Cl | Chloride | Ion chromatography with chemical suppresion | EPA 300.1 || NO3 | Nitrate | Ion chromatography with chemical suppresion | EPA 300.1 || SO4 | Sulfate | Ion chromatography with chemical suppresion | EPA 300.1 || PO4 | Soluble Reactive Phosphate | Colorimetric, Ascorbic Acid, Molybdate-blue | equivalent to EPA 365.1 Rev. 2.0 || Alm | Total Monomeric Aluminum | Colorimetric, Pyrocatechol Violet | McAvoy, et al, 1992 || Alo | Organic Monomeric Aluminum | Colorimetric, Pyrocatechol Violet | McAvoy, et al, 1992 || NH4 | Ammonium | Colorimetric, Alkaline salicylate | equivalent to EPA 350.1 Rev. 2.0 || Al | Aluminum | Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emmisions Spectrometry | similar to EPA 200.7 || Ca | Calcium | Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emmisions Spectrometry | similar to EPA 200.7 || Fe | Iron | Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emmisions Spectrometry | similar to EPA 200.7 || K | Potassium | Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emmisions Spectrometry | similar to EPA 200.7 || Mg | Magnesium | Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emmisions Spectrometry | similar to EPA 200.7 || Mn | Manganese | Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emmisions Spectrometry | similar to EPA 200.7 || Na | Sodium | Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emmisions Spectrometry | similar to EPA 200.7 || SiO2 | Silica | Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emmisions Spectrometry | similar to EPA 200.7 |## References**Merriam, J., W.

Soil Science Society of America Journal, 56(2), pp.449-455.; Current Protocols (2013 to present):; Streamwater samples are collected weekly in watersheds 1-9 upstream of the weirs, at the main stem of Hubbard Brook, and the M.Lake Outlet. Dedicated, site-specific, pre-labeled collection bottles are thoroughly DIW rinsed in between collection days and checked for cleanliness (Sp.Cond ≤ 2uS/cm) prior to sample collection. During each collection, a 1000 mL and a 60 mL LDPE bottle are filled and rinsed 3 times with streamwater prior to sample collection from the collection site. Samples are collected with no headspace in the 60 mL bottle to allow subsequent DIC analysis. A field temperature measurement is taken with an Oakton Acorn series thermistor, and gage height readings are recorded, along with any relevant field notes. One duplicate sample is taken each week at a rotating site for QA/QC.; Prior to water year 2013 (June 1, 2013), samples were not filtered or frozen prior to analysis. Since June 1, 2013 samples are brought back to the Pierce Lab, and immediately vacuum filtered through 0.7um GF/F filter into two pre-labeled 60 mL bottles. One bottle is frozen and the other is refrigerated before being shipped to the USFS Durham lab for cation/anion analysis.; DIC samples are immediately refrigerated and run within 24 hours of collection on a Shimadzu 8A Gas Chromatograph. pH, ANC and Specific Conductivity measurements are run at room temperature within 48 hours of collection. pH measurements are made on an Orion 3 Star pH meter with a glass Ross pH combination electrode. An additional pH measurement is run in parallel, during ANC titrations run on a Metrohm 888 Titrando titration system. ANC's are run using Gran titration methods with a titrant concentration of .02N HCl. Specific Conductivity measurements are run on a YSI model 32 Conductance meter.; Any remaining volume after lab analyses are completed is saved and poured off into acid washed 250 mL LDPE bottles, which are labeled and stored in the archive building.; Precipitation samples are collected weekly at rain gage sites RG22, RG1, RG4 (analyzed only if RG1 is contaminated), RG11, RG19, and RG23. In the event that precip is falling on a sample day, collections are postponed until the precipitation ends. A funnel/ bottle rain collector setup is used during the summer months, and 5 gallon HDPE snow buckets serve as collectors in the winter. All precip collection gear is acid washed annually prior to field deployment. Collectors are replaced weekly with a clean setup which has been tap water scrubbed and rinsed in copious amounts of DIW. All precip bottles/snow buckets are tightly capped and bagged at collection time to prevent contamination in transit.; Since June 1, 2013 filtered, frozen samples are thawed and then analyzed for multiple analytes and a subsample of filtered unfrozen water is analyzed for monomeric Aluminum and acidified and run on the ICP(full suite listed in Table 1). All methods used prior to 2013 are described in Buso et al. 2000 and have been recently updated the following publication by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station 2019 (USFS Durham Lab water analysis method detection limit (MDL) limit of quantification (LOQ), 2010 - present. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/890b1fadb61d3e86dc6f3d9afea79705; Throughout the history of HBWatER there have been changes in analytical protocols as new instrumentation or new techniques became available. The history of the record from inception to 2000 is well documented in Buso et al. 2000 and USFS Report 2019.; Project personnel:; Current Contributors: Tammy Wooster is responsible for weekly sample collection and sample analysis and processing in the Pierce lab. Geoff Wilson regularly assists in the weekly rounds. Jeff Merriam is responsible for chemical analyses of samples. Mike Vlah assists with data management. Chris Solomon and Emily Bernhardt are responsible for recruiting funding to sustain the record, approving data for publication, and data analysis for scientific discovery.; Past Contributors: For more than thirty years of this sixty year research effort Don C. Buso led the effort to collect, filter, and analyze samples and was responsible for data QA/QC and analysis. This record would not exist without Don’s careful attention to detail. Many technical support staff contributed to the collection, analysis, management and maintenance of these long-term biogeochemical data including Thomas Butler (1978-present), John Eaton (1965-1988), Donald Buso (1975-2015), Phyllis Likens (1973-2014), Lorie Burkes, Jonathan Crowdes, Larry Derosia, Brian Dresser, Yalinka Falusi, Marilyn Fox, Steffan Freeman, Michael Hallet, Roy Hamme, Herb Karsten, Alexia Kelley, Sue Koppes, Michael Koterba, Sherry Leis, James Lowe, Chris Masson, Brenda Minicucci, Ezra Morency, Olive McGregor, Alex McPhail, Scott Nolan, Barbara Polan, Ginny Scarlet, Denise Schmidt, Phyllis Sprague, Kathie Weathers and Roseanne Withington. Co- Founders, F. H. Bormann, N. M. Johnson and R. S. Pierce were instrumental in the initiation and conduct of this overall, long-term project (The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study).; Data verification: Quality analysis / quality control has been performed as described in Buso et al. (2000). All collected data are included in the dataset, including data that failed QA/QC controls; data that are questionably reliable are marked as “FALSE” in the QAQC column of the dataset, and should be treated with extreme caution.; Field Notes and Analysis Records: Field notes and field data collection notes are transcribed into weekly data sheets. When entered into HBWatER database, we carefully check that date, time of sample collection, temperature, gage height, precipitation amounts, codes and site observations are correct and within reported range. All chemical analyses conducted at the Pierce lab (pH, ANC, Specific Conductance and DIC) are entered into HBWatER and compared to historic and recent data ranges of lab analyses.; All lab analyses are compiled, periodically forwarded to the the Forest Service and archived. When chemical analyses are received from the Forest Service lab, all data is examined for obvious outliers. A team of the Forest Serve lab technician/lab manager, field technician/lab manager and data entry/ manager meet and review all results of chemical analyses. A list of reruns is complied of possible contaminated samples or errors in analysis. When reruns are complete and database is complete the new data are reviewed by the lead investigators prior to posting. All field notes are archived at the Hubbard Brook Forest Service office.; Note on compound solutes: Note that, with one exception, concentrations for compound solutes like NO3, SO4, and SiO2 are given as mass of the compound per volume. For instance, the NO3 concentration is (mass of NO3)/volume, not (mass of N in NO3)/volume. The only exception is PO4, for which the concentration is given as (mass of P in PO4)/volume. The column definitions indicate the correct concentration units in all cases, and may be read literally.; Citations:; Buso, D. C., G. E. Likens and J. S. Eaton. 2000.
